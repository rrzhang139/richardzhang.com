# Mass Commercialization of the Software Industry - Worsening Engineering Quality

### Abstract

To come.

## The Textbook Era

<i>
  Counterintuitive to many, the great generation of software developers in the
  80s and 90s emerged when educational resources were scarce. Perhaps, the
  resources were very well-written.
</i>

### Back In Time

In the 80s, software development was enitrely a different thing. Well, mostly in a boring but efficeint way.

My professors talk about how it took hours, sometimes days to compile a C++ program. Making a typo in the code sometimes required a recompilation from scratch. One can assume small mistakes could have vast consequences. <ins>This is how a generation of superb engineers was born, with motherly care of every line they coded.</ins>

Today, when we code, we likely get an error per four-five miutes, or maybe less. No one told us that it's a very big deal. The compiler script tells you the mistakes in a few seconds - still, of course, there are exceptions.

This was not the only difference. At the time, the Silicon Valley was mostly focused on hardware to speed up processor performance. Software engineers were mostly computer engineers, and they were more proficient in the low-level principles of computers. Open source was not very popular, but some activist computer scientists demanded all software to be made open source. Most importantly, people learned computer engineering from textbooks. Either at a college or at your desk, the only way to learn was reading.

Bacially, perspective on software engineering was conservative. Remmeber Neo from the Matrix? He'd be a good example.

### How Textbooks Paid Off

I repeat, it was a boring environment. Yet, as software engineers, we look at one thing: whether it works or not. This era in the 80s and 90s led to amazing global successes in the software industry. <ins>They were so productive that they created a transformation within the industry itself.</ins> People of this generation implemented Linux, Netscape, and numerous cool stuff.

Let's have a look at Linus Torvalds. It was 1991 when he launched the first kernel of Linux. He was 22. He used a textbook as a reference: <ExternalLink href="https://csc-knu.github.io/sys-prog/books/Andrew%20S.%20Tanenbaum%20-%20Operating%20Systems.%20Design%20and%20Implementation.pdf">Operating Systems: Design and Implementation</ExternalLink>. The textbook was not completely theorotical, it had code pieces and included the source code to an example operating system. Linux also had communal implications, which I won't get into to avoid distraction. I'll have some links in the resources section very below.

Another inspiring example comes from Ken Kocienda, former principle software engineer at Apple. He shares his story below in his book <ExternalLink href="http://creativeselection.io/">Creative Selection: Inside Apple's Design Process During the Golden Age of Steve Jobs</ExternalLink>. He was a history major who got into the sofwtare industry in the 90s. In 2001, when he was first asked to join Apple to build Safari in secret, it came from his friend who also gifted him a book, <ExternalLink href="https://github.com/camoverride/lit/blob/master/Javascript-The-Definitive-Guide.pdf">JavaScript: the Definitive Guide, 3rd Edition</ExternalLink>. The book was highly apprecited by Brendan Eich, the creator of JavaScript. When I had a look at the 7th edition of the book for the first time, I felt both embarassed and frustrated. I realized that we, aspiring software engineers of early 2020s, did not learn JavaScript to understand its low-level working mechanisms. We generally consulted to online content to learn how to code with it.

There are many good parts about textbooks that one should be aware of. They are written by academicians or researchers, who are highly skilled in textual communication and know the content thoroughly. They talk about theorotical optimizations that many online lecturers do not know about. And, they value experimentation and research, possibly the major reason our generation cannot get along well with them. We are impatient.

## Rise Of The Software Industry

<i>
  And as networking technologies became more accessible, they hit a very
  dangerous property of human nature, greed.
</i>

### The Valley, But Inflated

The hard work for improving processor performance paid off by mid 1990s, which led to a more software-orientated shift in the industry, both for open source and commercial. Apache web server was released, making it very simple to launch web servers from local computers. The Internet Protocol became publicly accessible. Things had changed. Now, it was easy to launch SaaS products, and everyone was a startup guy.

You maybe know how it is. Whenever there is a hype trend, big money is there. Not because everyone understands how things work, but beccause of a much simpler rule: as there is interest, there is valuation. In my opinion, this is the deadliest understanding in the tech industry.

Needless to say, at the time, the financial stabiltiy was strong in the US. Still, there was no big money for the software boom. There was gigantic money. People refer to this time as the <ins>dot-com bubble</ins>.

### Instant Expansion

Startups that secured millions of unnecessary dollars started to expand. They needed software engineers to specifically manage their web servers and frameworks, a job distant to traditional computer engineering. These people were really software engineers.

In the early days of the dot-com bubble, it was easy to find talented developers. But aspiring younglings could not keep up. And, how would they? New open source and commercial tools were released daily, and tech stacks were not standardized for modern development. A teenager trying to keep up with the industry looked like a droplet in the ocean.

Soon, online learning platforms emerged. The initial ones were blog posts, later followed by platforms that support visual content. Now, online learning was commercialized. And about the content quality, there were some issues. Online resources were for industry-specific use cases, far from foundational understanding. This is how they thought they would attract more users. It really worked. People followed online resources to save time in their learning so that they can jump into the industry faster. It was like a middle school track field competition, and everyone seemed to have forgotten about the marathon. <ins>This is how a generation of impatient developers was born, with the instant desire to make easy money in an inflated industry.</ins>

## 'Modern' Software Development

<i>
  Well, once something gets heavily commercialized, you start to forget about
  its technicality. People may have different opinions on the definition of
  modern software development, but whatever it is, it comes no before the stock
  prices.
</i>

### Education Of Aspiring Developers

Most of us do not read books before getting into the industry. After we get in, no, we still do not read. For a profession that directly derived from computer science and computer engineering, this is very unfortunate.

We see people who enter to the world of coding, develop their first project in Node.js, and then get a job. This is amazing. In time, as they get better at Node.js and level up, you can expect that they now know how to manage certificates within microservices. Oh, no, Heroku did it for them. Okay, no worries, let's ask them about the native HTTP module. Oh, no, they've only used Fastify or Express but never the native modules. Then, you will wonder, "do they ever know how Node.js works?" No.

Look anywhere on Udemy or YouTube, I tell you. You won't see low-level details of Node.js there, even though it's the most ppoular language on Udemy. This is not what the industry expects you to know. So, this is not what the content owners produce.

### Why Learn The Unnecessary

This is how the technology can progress, if we can build with foudnational knowledge.

### Commercialized Learning culture

Since the beginning of the early 20s, online resources were accessible. Of course, mass learning platforms like Udemy and Coursera were not there yet. Online education first started with online text.

People started to learn software Development

If you are an employer, you do not care about having edge software engineers. As long as they know the technicality of your product domain, you are safe.

I bet you did not fully read this title. It looks disgusting. Why is this a title? So, assume you want to code the following Python line.

<code>print("hello world")</code>

If you enter the one-left key for all the characters, what you get is

<code>oeubr\*gwkkiqieks(</code>

This is nonsense. But it somewhat represents what a wrongly built foundation would you to. Assume you have the almost right answer for each question but you know none of those exactly right. <ins>This is a culture of learning by getting answers</ins>.

If you are a software developer, you know that apps need to work and load fast. If you cannot contribute to the performance of an app, then you fail. Luckily, it is easy to measure app performance.

What about the implementation speed? It is a different story. Let's see what it used to be, how it started to change, and what kind of a misconception it has become today.

### 1990s - Distruptive Innovation and the Great Massacre

Software development in the early 90s was though. Compiling code took hours, sometimes days. Imagine you just changed one line of code and now how to wait for a day to see if it works. Yup, this was pretty much the software industry. What if you had a typo? Such a mistake would lead to recompilation of the program, which has financial and timely implications. The implementation process got longer, just because of a single character typo you did.

So, software engineers had to be rigorous with their code quality. <ins>This is how a great generation of software developers were born, with motherly care.</ins>

Microsoft, Oracle, and IBM were giants. It was a stable competition within the A league, and the work climate was very formal that software developers wore suits and ties. Initiatives were not given but technical skills were taught well.

The Silicon Valley was there, but maybe not as you think. At the time, accessibility of cloud computing was still a problem. Many companies in the South Bay were hardware-oriented, trying to commercialize cloud computing. Some looked promising and showed solid progress, especially the ones that explored distributed computing. Unfortunately, they all vanished after a stanford PhD named Larry Page experimented a genius approach. I will come to that soon.

Before that, I want to talk about a guy who changed the world at his 22. He followed a textbook to build his own operating system. It was nothing more than a side project he was curious about. Yet, it became nothing less than a foundation of modern software. This is Linus Torvalds building Linux by coincidence.

Maybe Torvalds did not prove his genius by following a textbook to build a demo. <ins>He proved it by publishing Linux open source.</ins> All of a sudden, thousands of developers started to contribute to the project. Simply by adding features and fixing bugs, they made Linux the most essential software tool ever. This caused a massive shakening in the indsutry, especially to many non-believers of the distruptive power of collective knowledge. This was a win for the Silicon Valley philosophy, where people did not need to wear suits and ties to work. Valley startups shared the <i>you are what you think</i> mentality.

Silicon Valley was a community of its own. It was not commercialized just yet but just about to. Hardware entrepreneurs who wanted to bring native alternatives to cheap software development had gathered the most successful techies around the South Bay. Stanford was there, so were its professors. Basically, Silicon Valley agents built the most desirable network for technological innovation in the world, with bright students, professors, innovators, visionaries, and domain experts. Apple was among the leaders, and the things looked bright in Sunnyvale. Rapid tech commercialization was now here.

This sounds exciting but has a major issue. It is hard to comemrcialize hardware. Only for software it is easier. An adaption had to take place, but it was a struggle. <ins>According to many, hardware capabilities were still lacking.</ins> This was sort of an egg-chicken problem. Hardware companies were bleeding. Accessible computing was just not there.

Some business ideas got affected less than others. Microsoft was one of them, as it already had commercialized software products. Yet, it had a new competitor. A 22 year old "kid" was rising fast, and he was not Linus Torvalds. This kid had built a search engine and founded Netscape. I will not get into the rivalry between Microsoft and Netscape here. Yet, this quote from a 1997 Seattle Times article will have a word or two [X].

> The Microsoft-Netscape head-butting began 18 months ago after George Gilder, author and research fellow for Seattle's Discovery Institute, had a long cover story in Forbes ASAP magazine headlined, "George Gilder Thinks This Kid Can Topple Bill Gates."

If you do not know who George Gilder is, you probably should. He is a renowned American economist with deep philosophical insights about the Silicon Valley. Oh, and about that "kid", he is Marc Andreessen, the co-founder of Netscape, Andreessen Horowitz, and many more.

### Software Development Back in the Days

At the time, there were other challenges than compiling code. One was learning how to code well. There were not that many jobs for programmers. There were mainly academic textbooks that covered Linux and C, arguably the most foundational concepts of software development. For example, Richard M. Stallman's <i>Design of the UNIX Operating System</i> was a core piece [X].

Why I am telling you these? I want you to visualize how major of a shift the software industry faced.

### The Deadly Shift

From my readings for the last couple months, I will list two key contributors to such a change.

- Exponentially increasing appeal to the use of open source, thanks to Linus Torvalds
- The deadly competition between tech giants

Let's start with the first one. It was 1992, when Linus Torvalds was a college student. He wanted to create his own operating system. So he followed the book <i>Operating Systems: Design and Implementation</i> as a guide to build his demo [X]. What he then called a demo became the foundation of the Linux kernel.

If you ask me, Torvald's greatest move was not implementing the core of Linux. <ins>He won by making Linux open source.</ins> All of a sudden, thousands of developers started to contribute to the project. Simply by adding features and fixing bugs, they made Linux the most essential software tool ever. This caused a massive shakening in the indsutry, especially to many non-believers of the distruptive power of collective knowledge.

If you want to read more about the communal effects of Linux, James Surowiecki explains well in his book <i>Wisdom of Crowds</i>.

After self-teaching with reliable resources, software developers needed to get themselves into the industry, still demanding at the time but not as much. Commercialized software development was just emerging, and the adaption was a struggle. The competition between tech giants was (and turned out to be) deadly. There are plenty of resources that explain the deadly competition between tech enterprises of the time. I will only share this enthusiastic quotation from a 1997 Seattle Times article [X].

> The Microsoft-Netscape head-butting began 18 months ago after George Gilder, author and research fellow for Seattle's Discovery Institute, had a long cover story in Forbes ASAP magazine headlined, "George Gilder Thinks This Kid Can Topple Bill Gates."

Back to the day. It was no easy to get a job. Tech giants were commonly pivoting their technical direction all of a sudden. Defense industry was always an option, but it had its own, custom everything. Defense companies were distant to the industry.

so was the demand to software engineers.

### Modern Software Development

In early 21st century, reading text is not popular as it once was. There are many tools and websites for rapid software development. Do you need a cache? Redis is open source. Do you need a database? There are hundreds of them. File storage, loggers, debuggers, and more. You can configure all those in minutes. Programming languages themselves are open source, if you really want to read. But, like, who did?

Many of these tools have very accessible and clear documentation. <ins>Using open source (or paid) third party services is not an issue. Understanding them is.</ins>

Aspiring software developers today are not interested in understanding the interiors of systems and tools. Many believe that knowing how to use a tool is enough to get into the industry. Unfortunately, they are right. Demand for software developers is growing. Knowing how to integrate tools get you a job.

Of course, you cannot know very much as a junior developer. Yet, junior developers of the past had the enthusiasm to learn and a characteristics to question and experiment. Young developers of the day mostly lack these skills.

Ten years from now, aspiring software developers will be experts at asking questions and get them answered, getting started on new stacks quickly, and adapting to new software tools. Yet, they will not have the foundations to contribute to the technology. Technically, they will be less capable.

This is a result of heavy reliance on the internet, especially platforms like GitHub and StackOverflow.

## Emergence of Commercialized Learning

Learning used to be hands-on investigation. Due to the internet and online resources, it has mostly become getting answers to specific needs. I refer to this as <ins>commercialized learning</ins>.

### Today, Learning is a Service

We all know why we are here today. Generally speaking, it is the internet and its culture of impatience. Technically speaking, I might claim it is Web 2.0. Whatever happened has happened. Now we are here, and no one reads anymore.

As software developers, we use StackOverflow to get our questions answered, Udemy to understand or clarify a new concept, GitHub to find useful code. This is the rapid and commercialized way but neither the reliable nor secure.

### Easy to Build but not Build Well

With commercialized learning, you can build APIs and design user interfaces. However, there will be lots of issues with them. Online resources teach you how to build something. They do not teach you how to protect, test or maintain it. Even the highest quality online learning resources:

- only cover unit tests
- barely touch on authentication and authorization
- do not discuss performance optimizations at all
- totally skip the system architecture side

These are all essential absences for reliable and secure software development. Such implementations and plans are necessary, even for MVPs.

### "Eat the Beginner" Philosophy

### "JSON Web Tokens are Good"

Almost all online online resources showed you how to use JSON Web Tokens. Lovely, right? No, they aren't. There are tens of security concerns about them, and they caused massive exploitations. Some may know about refresh tokens and think they may fix the issues with JSON web tokens. Unfortunately, this is a hoax. <a href='https://developer.okta.com/blog/authors/randall-degges/' target='_blank'> Randall Degges</a> from Okta says:

> JSON Web Tokens can be used to validate user locally without the need for a database but then you put yourself at risk for massive security issues [X]."

Why do software companies still use them? Why do online resources talk about how secure they are simply because they are encrypted? There are pragmatic reasons. You may already imagine what they are, but I will come to that topic later.

### "NoSQL is Faster"

When I was in my first full-time job, we had a brief discussion about migrating to Postgres from NoSQL. The director of engineering was there. A senior developer said it should not help because NoSQL will outperform Postgres. The director asked:

> How can you know? How do you think all those banking infrastructures work very fast? Have you tried?

So we tried. Turns out, NoSQL was still faster. Yet, this does not mean is always will be. There are many factors, from hardware capabilities to data sizes and types. We knew for our case because now we had tried.

Go and perform performance tests on basic CRUD operations. Then, change the model sizes and repeat the tests. Understand why one is faster than the other.

## Many Online Resources are Misleadingly Generalist

Online resources today proved ability to get you onto something quickly but not with the ideal quality. It is not that the instructors or authors are technically incapable. Well, maybe some of them but not all.

Instructors and authors try to engage with maximum number of customers - or fast production enthusiasts. <ins>They are focused on clarity and accessibility, so they reduce their technicality.</ins> It is no rocket science.

Also, many customers are new to software development - and this explains why they consult to such resources. So, instructors choose to make generalizations about the topics they cover to improve clarity.

So, many serial entrepreneurs build products with bugs, vulnerabilities, scalability issues etc. They receive a ton of funding to fix such issues later. Sometimes, they do. Sometimes, they don't. Sometimes, even worse, they can't.

### The "Boom" Point

What if the developers you hired do not have sufficient technical knowledge? This happens more than you think. Of course, you probably have a few senior developers to help you with the most crucial parts. They may not be enough. You may end up with many developers who are straight out of Udemy.

We forget about questioning. We forget about coming up with solutions. We get trapped in the open source culture, the impression that we will not come up with the best solution. So we just search for the best solution out there.

For example, when someone asks a question about the authentication, we say "just use JWTs." Many do not know that the founder of JWT himself expressed concerns about its security.

When it comes to learning the idea behind something, we look at Udemy. There are many introductory courses about many software development. Well, none provide a thorough explanation of the idea. They show you how to build something. They remain introductory. No, they are not advanced. Instructors try to appeal to maximum number of customers by not overcomplicating the material. If Udemy was the place to learn hands-on material, you would see there how to make a local HTTP server secure in Express.js. Almost all backend courses on Udemy use Express, but none with this feature came to my attention.

To clear things, Udemy is helpful

As the developer community, not many of us are used to reading. In fact, this is not idiosyncratic to the tech industry. There are too many online resources and posts that let developers solve almsot any problem. Yet, there might be something we are missing. If you look at the drivers behind technological innovation drivers, you will quickly realize to you that you are on a big mistake.

By innovation drivers, I don't mean entrepreneurs. I do not mean the ones who demand but create. I mean people like Ray Kurzweil. Some of you may know who he is. Below excerpt from Wikipedia will help.

> He was personally hired by Google co-founder Larry Page. Larry Page and Kurzweil agreed on a one-sentence job description: "to bring natural language understanding to Google [X]."

Surprising to many, Kurzweil has no Masters or PhD. Yet, he is a true researcher. You will agree with me if you read his book How to Create a Mind, a text that any scientist or AI researcher should read. Well, I do not share his excitement for many of his expectations about the future. But this does not change his excellent skills in various areas. He is the reason Google can learn from your talks today.

## Growing E-learning Offerings

The last decade showed phenomenal upgrade in online resource quality. Individual e-learning platforms like Udemy, Coursera, EdX emerged quickly. These services turned out to have some issues.

- Online content marketplaces like Udemy are accessible, but they let anyone become an instructor. Eventually, much of the content is shifting away from showing the best practices.
- Academically focused e-learning platforms like Coursera are not accessible to the general public.
- Verbal communication turned out to be ineffective to practice hands-on learning. Many learners used the same computer to follow the content and practice, so sliding the desktop view turned out to be very distracting.

As a result to the above issues and more, new competitors emerged in the market, with a more progressive mindset. Platforms like<a className='inline' href='https://egghead.io/' target='_blank'> Egghead.io</a> and <a className='inline' href='https://cloudacademy.com' target='_blank'> Cloud Academy</a> introduced themselves as <i>only learn what you need</i> platforms. Well, this paid off in some sense.

You can fix many issues with a <i>only learn what you need</i> approach. However, it will not help you build an accumulated, collective knowledge. The best quality knowledge you will be looking for, in the end of the day, exists. Unfortunate to many of you, you can find them in academic textbooks.

## Reliable Information Bases for Developers

By reliable, I mean the resources with best practices.

There are many academic and professional texts open to general public. Google Research has a great collection of resources for data mining, artificial intelligence, real-time system infrastructures, and networking. Still, they are heavily theorotical; you do not have resources to replicate their experiments.

For hands-on learning, there are strong texts with code pieces. They also offer good amount of academic and professional findings about security and runtime optimization. O'Reilly is one of the best examples. And what does it offer better? Let's have a deeper look.

### E-Learning and Textbooks: Comparing Quality

Online sources used: the combination of almost all popular Node.js courses on Udemy

Textbook used: O'Reilly's <i>Distributed Systems with Node.js</i> textbook.

- The textbook starts by explaining how the event loop in Node.js works. Online resources do not deep dive into the event loop.
- The textbook uses Fastify web framework. It is a lightweight, fast, and secure web framework with industry-leading maintainers. Online resources heavily use Express.js, very powerful but more introductory and less optimized web framework.
- The textbook discusses the cluster activity, management and monitoring for distributed systems. Online resources only show introductory deployment to a single cluster.
- The textbook deep dives into containerization. Online resources do not introduce this in any Node.js related course.

### Need for Further Experimantation

Emerging e-learning trend has significantly reduced the ability to question and experiment. The intuition that anything can be found online is not true.
