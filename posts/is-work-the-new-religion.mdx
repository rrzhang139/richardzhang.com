# Is Work the New Religion?

Recently, before accepting my first job out of college, I was met with a surprising sense of emptiness rather than fulfillment. I felt like there was a deep void in myself that can only be filled with work. 

But not just any work. 

Work with an identity. 

Something to represent myself with.

I mean, why do people always say “its personal news” when they get fired or hired? Because it is! In the modern era, work has become more than just a means to an end; it is an essential component of our identity, a representation of who we are. In many cases, our chosen careers align with our passions, values, and societal roles, becoming an intrinsic part of our self-concept. For instance, a human rights lawyer might view their career not merely as a job but as an embodiment of their commitment to justice.

## Early History
But this was always the case in early history! Why am I mentioning it now? I might sound crazy, but it seems like work has been eating into more and more of our lives and culture? Hyper-consumerism? Productivity? Wall Street bankers selling derivatives for juicy bonuses? Capitalism? (Ok I’m derailing here but I hope you get the point) But I think it’s more of a question of “is innovation and pursuit of knowledge increasingly becoming an important tailwind in our lives?”.  The rise of individualism, coupled with the expansion of career opportunities and the emphasis on self-actualization, has likely contributed to this shift. It’s a melting pot of capitalism, individualism, democracy, and other belief systems that contributed to this hyper-existential pursuit. 

In the past, the pursuit of knowledge and problem-solving often took a backseat to more immediate concerns, such as religious faith, or community ties. For most people, work was a means to put food on the table. This perspective can be traced back to pre-industrial societies, where the majority of the population was engaged in subsistence farming or artisanal crafts, and survival was the primary concern. 

But what was really important to fuel our deeper existential needs? Take religion, for example. Almost every small town had some kind of religious center symbolizing its central role in community life. Weekly services were not just a matter of faith but a communal gathering, binding people together in shared beliefs and social rituals.

## Modern Day
Fast-forward to the modern identity, with the emergent technologies of the internet and social media, we have access to a global identity shared by billions of people. I hypothesize social media has desensitized group identity that was so prevalent pre-internet, and although it erupted infinite possibilities of innovation, it also diluted old traditions and beliefs. During the Renaissance, the pursuit of knowledge was revived and celebrated, yet for centuries, it often remained in the shadow of more dominant existential narratives, such as religious faith. It’s only recently that humans have paid attention to rapid advancements in technology and the constant innovation in fields like artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and renewable energy.

Full disclosure, I’m not saying that people LOVE their jobs. For many individuals, work is primarily a means of securing financial stability and meeting basic needs. I just sense a general attention for innovation and redefinition of identity. Could be wrong tho, due to conflated variables :p

Work can represent various aspects of life, such as a sense of purpose, a pursuit of status, or a commitment to human progress. I think this is a symptom of modern life, and I hope we can overcome this as a generation some day.

Lastly it's worth mentioning how maintaining a healthy work life balance is the hardest thing to do especially with work eating away into our identities. How do you do it? Happy to chat about these questions.
