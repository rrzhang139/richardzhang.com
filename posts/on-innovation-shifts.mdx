## On Innovation Shifts

Innovations happen continuously. New innovations often leave the previous ones in the shadow, but change is good. These are the things we already know. But if we put these aside, why do we need innovations? What's wrong with the ones that we already have?

The problem may be us, humans. And if we are doing this to ourselves for all this time,

### Abusing the Gold

Earlier this month, I met a very early miner of Bitcoin. He thinks that Satoshi is an AI from the future. Yes, actually. After thinking for a while, I somewhat understood his perspective.

It was in 2008 when Nakamoto released the Bitcoin white paper. Interestingly, Bitcoin offered no decentralized finance, NFT marketplaces, crypto games, or anything similar. Bitcoin was an infrastructure for decentralized financial transactions but nothing else. Is it because its technology could not afford such use cases? It would be naive to think that way. It looks like Satoshi chose to do an intentional abstraction between pure financial transactions and applicational use cases. Probably, his philosophy was that financial transactions are the most critical to daily life.

People often compare how Bitcoin is similar to or different than gold, but they consider financial and circulation-related metrics. Something they skip is that neither can be abused; their use cases are fully financially driven. In the long term, this may become more important to the crypto community.

### The Application Layer

The application layer is a term widely used in the software industry. It refers to the layer where we build applications on top of an underlying technology. Think about Ethereum. It allows many games, decentralized applications, semi-centralized marketplaces, and more to be built on top of it. Ethereum achieves this with its extensible application layer. If there is a community of traders, sellers, and gamers on blockchain today, we owe it to primarily Ethereum.

Yet, technologies with extensible application layers have a critical risk: they are open to being abused by developers who build on them and users that use them. For Ethereum, Near, or Solana, this is the case. All are heavily commercialized with a highly accessible application layer, where they could be abused with uncontrollable adoption.

This hasn't become a critical social problem until now, but innovations in the previous years suffered greatly due to their application layers. Can this repeat?

### Innovationomics

The meaning of innovation still needs to be revised to have a collective consensus. I define it as "combining existing technologies or inventing new ones to build socially or economically constructive application layers."

Think about the current decentralized applications (games, de-fi, NFTs). Many of them are built on preexisting application layers like Ethereum. The same trend applies to centralized applications, as most use traditional distributed systems architectures and scalability services.

Applications are essential to provide user-friendly services and convenient user experiences. They are not innovative but are still very beneficial to society. Think about Discord, Duolingo, Netflix (or any decentralized app). They are all disruptive business ideas but not technologically innovative.

Innovations have a common fate of being industrialized. Well, this is very needed. Innovations are the reason we can do almost anything today. So limiting their adoption would not be wise of us. Yet, what can we expect will happen to innovations with extensible application layers, regardless of whether we like them?

### Historical Circularity

New innovations can happen anytime, but they tend to concentrate on when the application layers of current innovations are abused heavily. We tend to develop new innovations because we sometimes abandon the existing ones after overusing them. In that case, the following innovations appear to be a social response to the social issue caused by the past innovation.

One example is the commercialization of the Internet. This led to the early abuse of commercial distributed systems, primarily client-server models. GPS, search engines, and web browsers followed as new applicational use cases.

As a response, people showed greater interest in AI and decentralized systems. This isn't a social reaction to the dot-com bubble, but what? Both technologies tend to reduce human impact in contribution and regulation. We blamed each other after the dot-com bubble, as this was the fault of human greed. So, what did we do? Unconsciously, we limited ourselves by raising new technologies that took control away from us. Well, I defend that these new innovations are good for society, but it's out of scope.

### AI From the Future?

Well, I prefer something other than combining reason with extraordinary or post-human ideas.

Yet, now I see why one might think that Satoshi is an AI from the future. Bitcoin can thrive without outside abuse, so people will have no problem with it and keep running its nodes. This is how it is self-sustainable. Bitcoin tried to break this historical cycle, something only a top-tier intellect could have visioned.

So what? Will it survive endlessly? I don't think so.

### Human Soul

Technologies fade when their time comes. For natively smart contract executable blockchains, I expect this to happen due to mass adoption and abuse in the application layer.

Also, for Bitcoin, I think its time will come someday. There are efforts to increase the capabilities of Bitcoin already, some to extend its application layer. Some oppose it, but I support such work. Of course, this would make Bitcoin vulnerable to outside abuse, but maybe this is not an issue.

It is easier to adapt to what's coming rather than conflicting with our nature of questioning and experimenting with new things. But, honestly, without some excitement, curiosity, and greed, who would ever evolve?
