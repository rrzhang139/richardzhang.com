## On Innovation Shifts

Some technologies fade simply because they cannot handle growth or stability. Some fade because we greedy humans mostly blame technologies without sufficiently analyzing the context. This article explores the philosophical and immutable patterns in the rise and fall of software innovations.

### Abusing the Gold

Earlier this month, I met a very early miner of Bitcoin who
thinks Satoshi is an AI from the future. Yes, actually.

It was in 2008 when Nakamoto released the Bitcoin white paper. If you think about the blockchain ecosystem today, you will realize the massive decentralized finance space, NFT marketplaces, and perhaps more - in a sense, these are all decentralized applications. Bitcoin offers none of these. Instead, Bitcoin is only an infrastructure for financial transactions. Different from the case for Ethereum or many other blockchains today, it is not very possible to build decentralized applications on top of Bitcoin. We must consider why, even though we cannot know for sure.

Did Satoshi expect other Layer 1 protocols to emerge? Sure did. Did Satoshi expect some of these to support decentralized applications? Sure did. If you have designed this kind of new decentralized architecture, then you can easily guess how it will be improved by others. Yet, why didn't he build such support himself (or herself, or whatever)?

He didn't feel the need to; he was a firm believer in simplicity. I imagine Satoshi explaining his primary philosophy as follows:

"Financial transactions are the most critical to pursue daily life. Providing built-in use cases for decentralized applications is less important."

If you think for a second, this will make sense. Why would you commercialize Bitcoin if a cafe owner can use it to accept payments anyway? However, implementing Bitcoin as a payment standard for all business types, such as games or paid media platforms, can be challenging. So, why did Satoshi avoid this in Bitcoin?

By not providing an extensible application layer, Satoshi protected the fate of Bitcoin so that it could not be abused.

### The Application Layer

What is this? 'Application layer' is a term that some use in the software industry - and I wouldn't be surprised if other sectors do. It refers to the layer where we build applications on top of an underlying technology.

Think about Ethereum. It allows many games, decentralized applications, semi-centralized marketplaces, and more to be built on top of it. If you wonder what the simple answer is that it has an application layer.

We cannot say the same for Bitcoin. To repeat the commong saying, "Bitcoin does not allow the transaction of information," but just money. Well, this is mostly true, and answering why not wholly accurate is beyond the scope here.

Bitcoin did not provide an extensible application layer because, who knows. My personal take is that it saw how it could be abused by hundreds of thousands of developers, which would

1. damage the circulation trend of a very limited currency supply
2. bring along issues with redundant application usage

We need some kind of regulation to pursue decentralized systems. As long as this regulation is not human-centric and technically and socially self-sustainable. This is how things work.

### The Art of Abusing

So, how do we abuse the gold? We cannot. Some of it is still underground, and we can extract it on a timed basis with a given upper bound. We literally depend on it, so how can we?

For Bitcoin, I don't know if we depend on it, but the same principle applies. It is hard to build applications on it. With that being said, it is still possible. However, it requires deep technical understanding, and it is not a commercialized area. Frankly, I don't see how we can abuse a non-commercial space. Especially if people are not interested in commercializing it.

For Ethereum, Near, or Solana, this principle does not apply. This is because they are heavily commercialized with a highly accessible application layer, where they could be abused with uncontrollable adoption.

It might sound ironic when I say this now, but I admire extensible application layers. They just need a bit more philosophical reconsideration. Otherwise, they may eventually drag this influential technology of blockchain to collapse.

### Innovationomics

Who said innovations come from the blur? If looked carefully enough, everything has a pattern of occurring.

So, first, let's think for a minute. What is innovation? Make sure to think about yourself first, but my answer is:

"Combining existing technologies or inventing new ones to build socially or economically constructive application layers."

Assume that you build a blockchain that does not allow sending money or any other information. What is it for? Nothing, and obviously, it is not an innovation. On the other hand, if you address a social issue simply by using what is already provided for you, then what you do is excellent service and business potential. Yet, it is not an innovation. Many of the (if not all) decentralized and centralized applications today simply use preexisting application layers to build products. They don't come up with their own.

Naturally, you can only expect some people to come up with an innovation. This won't be sustainable. Humanity needs applications and solutions for different use cases. If everyone innovates (which I assume to be practically and theoretically impossible), no one will build on top of application layers. This is an issue.

What about the opposite? Why let's just not use the innovations built to date? Why do we need a further innovative push? And how would this kind of semi-technocracy (if you define it so, I don't) benefit humanity?

### Historical Circularity

Innovations tend to appear on specific historical timelines. I am not yet sure if this means a direct relationship from a statistical perspective. However, history has spoken. One cannot change it.

The historically repeating thing is the abuse of the application layer. Abusing application layers contributed to social crises in the past ~40 years since the emergence of the Internet.

Think about the dot-com bubble. A mass crisis happened as many thousands of launched startups abused the client-to-server application layer. The application layer grew exponentially as search engines, GPS apps, WIFI apps, web browsers, and more emerged. An enormous crowd gathered around the application layer of client-to-server architecture, and everyone tried to make some money out of it. As it didn't work, people blamed the (1) people who tried to take advantage and (2) technology. It is a matter of significant discussion whether the second one was in place.

So, people showed greater interest in peer-to-peer (p2p or decentralized) networks, artificial intelligence, and other areas. Moreover, some areas involved the intersection of others, such as federated learning that specializes in the decentralized training models of artificial intelligence models.

So, is today the innovation base only for crypto? Fortunately not. Generative AI with GPT-3 is an incredible application layer, and 5G has more to offer in terms of adoption. Furthermore, high-performance 3D game engines have a not-ending future. So, where are we going?

### AI From the Future?

Well, I don't prefer combining reason with extraordinary or post-human ideas. I think that the proposal and initial design of Bitcoin can be made by a small group (or possibly someone) of very high intellect that has put in the extreme work required. Still, after some thought, it is possible to see why this person I met thinks about some post-human interference.

As of now, it is not reasonably possible to abuse Bitcoin. This is why it is actually self-sustainable. Bitcoin may have appeared as an effort to isolate the fate of financial transactions from many other technologies victimized by the abuse of application layers. Realizing this kind of social issue at the time requires a more excellent vision than even proposing Bitcoin. This may be the core temptation behind thinking about post-human aspects.

### Adapting

This is a highly controversial topic, but I believe that Bitcoin needs more extended features because this is the only way to gather a globally aware community around any technology. So, may this lead to its abuse in the future? This depends on how much its features can be extended in the first place, but eventually, yes, possibly.

I don't see this as an issue. This is fine as we shift technologies anyway. It is easier to adapt to what's coming rather than blame our kind.

This won't be a good perspective, but let's be honest: without human greed and manipulation, how would we ever shift from one thing to another? How would we evolve?

### Expectations

Dynamism is the most critical aspect of life. Things change all the time but never fade completely. Yet, even though something will never get lost completely, changes still need to occur.

Are dot-com websites over? I buy around five domains every year to build on them. Who doesn't use web browsers today? They were a part of a past major crisis. Yet, they sometimes shift to be valued less as more things come. It is not technology but human greed and manipulation that we are suffering. We cannot change this. So, we shift technologies. This is unfortunate, but, to repeat the above, it is easier to adapt to what's coming rather than blame our kind.

The application layer abuse of crypto is proven already. Is it over? No. Refrain from considering FTX or Luna crises (or similar things that did not happen yet but will before you read this). They cheated the game: they did not use the application layer as expected. Just with the ones that play the game by rules, we can cause a financial crisis. Expect some to start talking about new alternatives to the blockchain and distributed ledgers. Who knows if hashgraphs won't become a rising trend in three years from now?

After this point, it is not only about coming up with innovation but seeing how it will be misused and what kind of eventually consistent social reaction will occur to that.
